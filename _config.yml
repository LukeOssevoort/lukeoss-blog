# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  This blog is mostly an exercise in forcing me to write. It 
  is an elaborate ruse to force me to get of my ass and get 
  typing. If not to type jokes like I should be doing then 
  at least I can rant and rave about something I have read, 
  watched or otherwise experienced. So this blog is devoted 
  to what inspires me, piques my interest, moves the needle.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "https://blog.lukeoss.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
