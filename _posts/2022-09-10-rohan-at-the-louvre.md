*Rohan at the Louvre* is a rare treat and the perfect way to start of this blog. Not only does it blend 2 great comics traditions, Franco-Beligian [bande dessinÃ©e][BD wiki] (or BDs for short) and Japanese [manga][Manga wiki], but it is one of the few narrative works of [Hirohiko Araki][Araki wiki] that is fully coloured by the man himself. That word salad might not mean a lot to you now but hopefully by the end of this post you'll see why all that is a big deal.

The manga influence should be obvious given that the damn thing is written by a mangaka (Japanese cartoonist). What is less obvious is the French influence. You see, *Rohan at the Louvre* was originally drawn to be exhibited in the Louvre as part of a special comics exhibition. Because of this *RatL* is published in the style of French BDs, making it larger than the novel-sized manga volumes. It also means it is hard cover and full colour (manga usually having only a few pages coloured).

![Final Panel][Final Panel]

This change of format gives Araki's stellar art a place to shine. Not even the premium reprints of his series *JoJo's Bizzarre Adventure* can touch this. The usual Araki touches are there; the use of [hatching][Hatching wiki] rather than [screentones][Screentone wiki], the dynamic panel layouts, and the high-fashion style designs and poses. In addition to the usual touches is something usually restricted to his covers and art exhibitions, full colour. Araki elects to colour for tone rather than sticking to some kind of official colour scheme, adding so much to every scene. Even in the meager selection of images in this post there is so much variety in the pallette.

![Louvre Spread][Louvre Spread]

The writing is also in line with Araki's signature style, mixing realisitic (in the loosest sense of the word) folklore with absurd supernatural "battles". I wrote "battles" there because conflict in Araki's manga rarely plays out like a conventional fight. They can be anything from a desparate scramble to survive an incomprehensible threat to a high stakes poker game to the plot of the movie *Speed*.

If the art is appealing to you this comic needs to be on your shelves. The story is fun, if brief, but then again you are really getting this for the pretty pictures. So to finish this off here is a few more of Araki's illustrations.
